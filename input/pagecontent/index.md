# Lithuanian Lifestyle Implementation Guide

## Introduction and Purpose

This IG specifies how to consistently represent and exchange critical non-clinical patient data related to **lifestyle and health behaviors** using the **Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)** standard. The accurate capture and sharing of this information is vital for comprehensive patient care, risk stratification, chronic disease management, and public health initiatives.

## Scope and Core Observations

This guide provides structured FHIR profiles and guidance for a core set of lifestyle factors, including:

* **Tobacco Use:** Smoking status, exposure, and cessation history.
* **Alcohol Use:** Consumption patterns, screening results (e.g., AUDIT), and intervention history.
* **Physical Activity:** Exercise frequency, duration, and intensity (e.g., using METs).
* **Dietary Intake:** Specific nutrient consumption (e.g., sodium, sugar) and overall dietary patterns.
* **Biometric Data:** Relevant screening observations like **Cholesterol** (Lipid Panel).

## Why Use This Guide?

By adopting these profiles, implementers can ensure a standardized approach to:

1. **Interoperability:** Facilitate seamless, semantic exchange of lifestyle data between Electronic Health Records (EHRs), patient portals, research systems, and public health registries.
2. **Data Quality:** Improve the consistency, completeness, and clinical utility of recorded observations through mandated value sets and data types.
3. **Clinical Utility:** Support clinical decision support, quality measure reporting, and population health management efforts that rely on accurate behavioral and biometric context.

Navigate the sections below to access the profiles, terminology bindings, and detailed examples needed to implement the standard.
